## Development

Start the development frontend server:

```bash
# install dependencies from package-lock.json
npm ci

# run the development server
npm start

# see the development preview at http://localhost:1234
```

Optionally start the simple PHP backend server in another terminal:

```bash
cd simple-php-backend
php -S localhost:8080

# NOTE: you need to have the .env file present with this line in it,
# otherwise the frontend will not know where to connect to:
SIMPLE_PHP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

Read the [Development Setup](docs/development-setup.md) documentation page to see how to develop, debug, and deploy the project.
