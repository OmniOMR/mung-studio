Controller is a global service, that is reposible for handling user interations with the application. It may store state, but it's UI-related state, not domain-related. Controllers exist as singleton services in the global react context (EditorContext).

The `IController` interface is for controllers that want simply to a) listen to mouse and keyboard events b) have tinykeys key bindings c) render things to the foreground layer. These controller can simply implement the hook methods and handle their logic. More complex controllers (e.g. `ZoomController`) do not implement the interface, since they do not need most of the mentioned functionality and they also serve as dependencies to `IController`s - they are more "low-level". These `IController` controllers usually implement application-specific logic, e.g. individual editor tools.
